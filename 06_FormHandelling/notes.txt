--------------------------------------------
1. What is a Cookie?
A cookie is a small piece of data stored in the user's browser by the server. It is sent with every HTTP request made to the server.
✅ Use:
Store small data like authentication tokens, user preferences, etc.
Stateless — server doesn't store data, browser does.
2. What is a Session?
A session stores data on the server and gives the client a sessionID via a cookie. When the client sends the sessionID back, the server retrieves their data.
✅ Use:
Login systems
Cart items
Temporary stateful user data
🔐 More Secure than cookies:
Data is not exposed to the client, only the session ID is.
